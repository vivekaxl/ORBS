This is a collection of genereated slices by ORBS as presented in the
FSE 2014 paper [1].

The data should be looked at based on the ORBS distribution which is
available at

http://crest.cs.ucl.ac.uk/resources/orbs/

Structure
=========

* _example_ contains the three sliced files from the example in the
  FSE 2014 paper [1].

* _swig_ contains three different slices for the files taken from the swig
  distribution [2].

* _hanoi_ contains the two sliced files for a Towers of Hanoi
  implementation [3].

* _calendar_ contains the 16 slices generated from four different
  calendar implementations [4].
  
* _printtokens_ contains the nine slices generated from the printtokes
  example taken from the SIR [5].

* _notepad_ contains the slice for the Java notepad example [6].

* _concordance_ contains the slice generated from the concordance
  example taken from the SIR [5].

* _bash_ contains four directories for the four experiments, each
directory contains the generated slices only [7].
